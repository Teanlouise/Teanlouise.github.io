# **ABOUT ME**

>Hi! My name is Tean and while I may not meet all your tick boxes now, I will. I am a current Computer Science student and Business Management graduate with a passion for collaborating and problem solving to find the best solutions for a better future.

**I love a challenge.** 

When I started at STA Travel I had no idea how to be a travel agent, but after just 9 months I was promoted to Store Manager after being named top travel agent in Queensland for 2017. 

**I am self-motivated.**

In addition to my university studies, I have learnt how to use git effectively, github pages, create pypi packages, pytest and TravisCI through online resources. 

**I have a passion for learning.**

While other teams completed their cloud web applications, I built Shared World individually with Django and React with no prior knowledge and was awarded ‘Best Use of Cloud’ for my cohort.

_BigQuery, Dataproc, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage, Django, React, Scala, Apache Spark_

A cloud application solution for overtourism and promoting responsible travel by providing a platform where travellers explore destinations using a map displaying tourist-to-local ratios and view blogs filtered by their interests. It is a platform where responsible, conscientious travellers can be made. 

This project was the assessment item for **Cloud Computing** (INFS3208) at University of Queensland. The [proposal](https://teanlouise.github.io/shared-world/proposal) was submitted as assignment 1 and this implementation as assignment 2. Both assessment pieces recieved full marks. In addition the project was nominated for the best project award and was awarded the 'Best Use of Cloud' for the cohort (62 projects submitted). A live and recorded explanation, including demonstration of the project was given.

![pacman_game_title](./images/project_pacman.PNG)

This version of the traditional 'Pacman' game was implemented over the course of three assignments for **Programming in the Large** (CSSE2002) at University of Queensland. The overall goal of the project was to gain confidence with writing, reading and testing code in Java that expands multiple classes. The marking criteria was according to correct functionality (55%), code review (25%) and successful tests (20%). Each assignment received a high distinction.

![asteroids_title](./images/project_asteroids.PNG)

Using basic C with Atmel Studio, a “Space Invaders” game was modified to allow push button and keyboard interaction, hit detection, speed variation and scoring on a LED matrix, seven segment display and serial terminal (puTTY). This was submitted as the project for **Introduction to Computer Systems** (CSSE2010) in which I also had the opportunity to complete projects focused on logic diagrams, logic gate design and constructing logic circuits using a breadboard.

![travel_inspo_title](./images/project_travel_inspo.PNG)

Using Python, I developed a travel destination recommendation program demonstrating the use of control structures and functional decomposition. It was submitted as Assignment 1 for **Introduction to Software Engineering** (CSSE1001) at University of Queensland. Software design choices and documentation were a key aspect of the grading criteria. This assessment received a High Distinction, and all feedback has been applied in this solution.

![exoplanet_title](./images/project_exoplanet.PNG)

An interactive space exhibit for a musuem was designed using basic python skills, and communicated to both science rookies and enthusiasts. This project was submitted as the Python and Communication Assignment for **Theory & Practice in Science** (SCIE1000) at the University of Queensland. The project received full marks. Understanding of mathematical modelling, using python at basic level, commenting to a high standard and communicating effectively to the audiences were the key marking criteria.

![blackjack](./images/project_blackjack.PNG)

A simple blackjack game. This was completed as the milestone 2 project for Jose Portilla's "Zero-to-Hero Python" course. Basic Python functionality inlcuding Object-Oriented programming practices were used to implement this project. Multiple tests were written in pytest and setup for automatic testing with **Travis CI**.
