A cloud application solution for overtourism and promoting responsible travel by providing a platform where travellers explore destinations using a map displaying tourist-to-local ratios and view blogs filtered by their interests. It is a platform where responsible, conscientious travellers can be made. 

This project was the assessment item for **Cloud Computing** (INFS3208) at University of Queensland. The [proposal](https://teanlouise.github.io/shared-world/proposal) was submitted as assignment 1 and this implementation as assignment 2. Both assessment pieces recieved full marks. In addition the project was nominated for the best project award and was awarded the 'Best Use of Cloud' for the cohort (62 projects submitted). A live and recorded explanation, including demonstration of the project was given.

Using basic C with Atmel Studio, a “Space Invaders” game was modified to allow push button and keyboard interaction, hit detection, speed variation and scoring on a LED matrix, seven segment display and serial terminal (puTTY). This was submitted as the project for **Introduction to Computer Systems** (CSSE2010) in which I also had the opportunity to complete projects focused on logic diagrams, logic gate design and constructing logic circuits using a breadboard.
